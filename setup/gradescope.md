# Gradescope

Upon completion of a programming assignment, all source code must be
uploaded to Gradescope for automated grading.

Before doing so, ensure that the code compiles without warnings or
errors. This can be done by building the project using PlatformIO.

## Logging in to Gradescope

Access the Australian Gradescope site using the following URL: [Gradescope AU](https://www.gradescope.com.au/).

Students are not required to create an account on Gradescope and can
instead login using SSO (Single Sign-On) by clicking the "Log in with
School Credentials" button. This will display a list of available
institutions, from which "Queensland University of Technology" should
be selected.

Once logged in, the relevant course and assignment can be selected from
the dashboard.

## Uploading a Project

To upload a project to an assignment portal, follow the steps below:

1. Open the project directory in a file explorer. This can be done by
   right-clicking any file in the Explorer tab on VSCode and selecting
    "Reveal in File Explorer".

2. Select all files **inside** the project directory and create a ZIP
   archive. Most operating systems have built-in support for creating
   ZIP archives.

3. Click on the relevant assignment to open the submission box. If
   resubmitting, click the Resubmit button on a previous submission.
4. Drag and drop the ZIP archive into the submission box.
5. Click the Upload button to finalise the submission.

A successful submission should display results for each exercise
within the assignment.
